# Pomodoro

Currently all this is a Pomodoro timer where you enter your focus goal, the time you want to focus in one go and clock it. It sends you notifications once your focus or break time is up, and is a handy little app. 

For future reference, this is part of a larger project where I'm trying to make an app that offers all the functionality I need combined - a to-do list/focus tracker, my gym tracker, a tracker for my goals and my progress all rolled into one.
