# Pomodoro

Currently all this is a simple Pomodoro app with a limited GUI, that I plan on building from scratch and growing into a multi-purpose tool for 4 main purposes: Tracking my workouts, my daily goals, my progress with those goals on a longer timeframe and a simple task manager/timer mixed in one.
